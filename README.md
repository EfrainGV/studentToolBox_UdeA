# Student ToolBox UdeA
## 🌟 Project Overview

"Student Toolbox UdeA" is an interactive platform designed to centralize academic resources and provide practical tools for students in the Systems Engineering program at the University of Antioquia. The platform aims to:

1. Simplify access to quality study materials, tutorials, and guides.
2. Offer utilities like an interactive curriculum and tech resource library.
3. Encourage early planning, studying and resource sharing.
4. Help students get to other academic/faculty sites faster with a centralized hub of information.

This project is built using Astro with TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS, ensuring a highly responsive and dynamic web experience. Stay tuned as we continue building and refining the platform to meet the evolving needs of students.


## 🗂️ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Component1.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout1.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Directory `src/components/`,is where you should put any Astro/React components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🛠️ Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
